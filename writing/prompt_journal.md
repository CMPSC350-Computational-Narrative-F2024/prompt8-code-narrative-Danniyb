## 1. Prompts Used

TODO: try at least three variations and use the same final prompts for both Copilot and another LLM

```
a pyhton code that reflects Collaboration: 
As Code that reflects teamwork and collaboration, perhaps through functions that interact or share data.
```

## 2. Prompting Strategy

TODO: What was your strategy with prompting. What worked and what didn't work? Did you employ a specific prompting technique (zero-, few-, many-shot, chaining, chain of thought, meta prompting)?

## 3. Output Evaluation
TODO:

For each generated code output, consider:
    - Narrative Structure: How does the organization reflect the theme? Is there a clear flow that resembles a narrative?
    - Commentary and Documentation: How do Copilotâ€™s comments contribute to the narrative? Do they add meaning to the code?
    - Design Choices: Evaluate how Copilot's naming conventions, variable usage, and logic choices enhance or detract from the narrative.

### Copilot

TODO: evaluation

### Other Single LLM

TODO: evaluation

## 4. Reflection

TODO: How did your prompt iterations impacted the narrative quality of the generated code? How did Copilot's suggestions supported or hindered the story within the code?
